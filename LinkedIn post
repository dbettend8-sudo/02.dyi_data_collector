**Good data starts at the moment of collection. If the process is clunky, the dataset will never be reliable.**

**Part 1 â€” Building the foundation for personal finance tracking**

Every analysis depends on the quality of the data behind it. But when it comes to personal finance, poor user experience is often the main reason data quality breaks down.  

If it takes too long to log a transaction, the habit fades and the dataset loses consistency. That was happening with my current approach: too many clicks, too much friction.  

So I designed a simple data collector app in AppSheet, connected directly to Google Sheets. The focus is on making data entry effortless:  
- clear categories to reduce ambiguity  
- date automatically set to today  
- fast toggle between income and expenses  
- one tap to save  

The result is higher quality data, because the process is lightweight enough to sustain every day.  

This project has two parts. In Part 1 we create the database and the app that writes to it. Then we wait for the database to grow. In Part 2 we connect reporting tools to read from the database and turn raw logs into visual insights.
