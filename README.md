# Goals

- Provide a **simple, generalized tool** for collecting data into Google Sheets with minimal friction.  
- Reduce input steps: **open → type → choose category → auto-fill date → submit**.  
- Support **flexible use cases** like journaling, expense tracking, habit logging, or quick notes.  
- Leverage **AppSheet** for a no-code, mobile-friendly interface.  
- Keep the setup **extensible** so users can add fields, categories, and validation as needed.  
- Document the process so others can **replicate or adapt** it easily.  
- Evolve into a full tutorial + shareable template over time.
