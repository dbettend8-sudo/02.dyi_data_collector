# Goals

- Provide a **simple, generalized tool** for collecting data into Google Sheets with minimal friction.  
- Reduce input steps: **open â†’ type â†’ choose category â†’ auto-fill date â†’ submit**.  
- Support **flexible use cases** like journaling, expense tracking, habit logging, or quick notes.  
- Leverage **AppSheet** for a no-code, mobile-friendly interface.  
- Keep the setup **extensible** so users can add fields, categories, and validation as needed.  
- Document the process so others can **replicate or adapt** it easily.  
- Evolve into a full tutorial + shareable template over time.


# Data Collector â€” Part 1  
*Building the foundation for personal finance tracking*

This project shows how to assemble a simple data collection app in AppSheet that writes directly into Google Sheets.  
The goal is to make expense and income logging effortless, so data quality stays high and consistent.

## Resources

I'm using the structure bellow

- 1 Google Sheet with 5 tabs:  
  - `Expenses` â†’ for spending  
  - `Income` â†’ for earnings  
  - `Staging` â†’ temporary input buffer   
  - `ExpensesTypes` â†’ distinct expense types  
  - `IncomeTypes` â†’ distinct income types  


You can use this link to make a copy of the document in your google account. Make sure you enable editing and delete the dummy data on all the tables!

([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/FILE_ID/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-7r4feTc4ek_SCIUcxHISn6DSkw-5M9H1cIISFR-xnI/copy))

While you are at it you can add a few categories to the Types tables...

## Step 1: Connect to AppSheet

- Go to [AppSheet](https://www.appsheet.com/)  
- **Start with your own data** â†’ select your spreadsheet  
- In **Data â†’ Tables**, add all 5 sheets  
- Regenerate each table so AppSheet recognizes the columns

## Step 2: Configure Columns  

### In `Staging`  

- **Mode**  
  - Type: Enum  
  - Values: `Expenses`, `Income`  
  - Input mode: Buttons  

- **Label** â†’ Text  

- **Type**  
  - Type: Enum  
  - Input mode: Dropdown  
  - **Valid_If**:  
    ```appsheet
    SWITCH(
      [Mode],
      "Expenses", SORT(ExpensesTypes[Expenses Type]),
      "Income",   SORT(IncomeTypes[Income Type]),
      LIST()
    )
    ```

- **Value** â†’ Decimal (or Price)  

- **Date** â†’ Date  
  - Initial value: `TODAY()`

## Step 3: Build the Form  

- Go to **UX â†’ Views â†’ + New view**  
  - Name: `Add Row`  
  - For this data: `Staging`  
  - View type: Form  

- Column order: `Mode â†’ Label â†’ Type â†’ Value â†’ Date`

## Step 4: Add the Actions  

Create 4 actions in **Behavior â†’ Actions**:  

1. **Add to Expenses**  
   - For: `Staging`  
   - Do this: *Data: add new row to another table* (`Expenses`)  
   - Map: Date=[Date], Label=[Label], Type=[Type], Value=[Value]  
   - Only if: `[Mode]="Expenses"`  

2. **Add to Income**  
   - Same, target = `Income`  
   - Only if: `[Mode]="Income"`  

3. **Delete Staging row**  
   - For: `Staging`  
   - Do this: *Data: delete this row*  

4. **Submit (Grouped)**  
   - For: `Staging`  
   - Do this: *Grouped: execute a sequence of actions*  
   - Actions: Add to Expenses, Add to Income, Delete Staging

## ðŸ–² Step 5: Hook Submit to the Form  

- Go to **UX â†’ Views â†’ Add Row (Form)**  
- Under **Event actions â†’ Form Saved** select `Submit`  
- Set **Auto save = ON** for smoother experience

---

## Step 6: Test  

- Open the app preview (phone view)  
- Select **Expenses** â†’ fill out form â†’ Save  
  - Row should appear in `Expenses`, staging clears  
- Select **Income** â†’ repeat

## In summanry

You now have:  
- A fast, structured data entry app  
- A clean database in Google Sheets  
- Categories pulled dynamically from lookup tables  

**Next (Part 2):** connect this database to reporting tools (Looker Studio) to generate insights.
